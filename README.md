# Description:

This final dissertation project demonstrates Physically Based Rendering (PBR) using the widely known Cook-Torrance BRDF. Additionally it also showcases other BRDFs like Blinn-Phong, Disney and Oren-Nayar BRDF. All 3D models were downloaded from Sketchfab.

​
Additionally, it also showcases different post-processing effects like Bloom, Vignette and SSAO.

It also uses ImGui framework for tweaking parameters at runtime as well as for profiling performance.

Graphics API: OpenGL 4.20
